##Front-end: Fluid grid application
Overview
Develop a UI application in Javascript in which user can create a dynamic grid of boxes. User will 
select number of columns from a dropdown and click on “Create Grid” button to create/reset to an 
empty grid container on the page. There will be an “Add box” button clicking on which a box should
be added to the grid while maintaining the column size set earlier. Also the box should display an 
auto incremented index to visually identify the box added. There should be a “x” button to remove 
the box. On clicking this remove button the remaining boxes should get auto arranged.
This is an open-ended task with no specific design, where the choices regarding presentation
and user interaction are left to the developer.
Technologies
Javascript without using any library.
You can use Jquery.
The resulting application shouldn’t require any server side code (JAVA, PHP, nodeJS, etc).
Outcome
Upon submitting the code we’ll be looking at the overall result of your work, including but not 
limited to:
• Code should be well structured and optimized. 
• The presentation and user experience
• Best practices
• Layout should be intuitive and elements are properly labelled on UI
